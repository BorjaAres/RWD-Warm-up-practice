# Practice RWD Education Website

This is a quick practice web page created as part of my studies. The goal was to build a simple web page using HTML and CSS to refresh my knowledge.

## Header

The header section contains the title "RWD" and a subtitle "EDUCATION." It also includes navigation links to different sections of the website.

## Main Content

The main content of the web page consists of a grid layout. Each grid item contains an image and accompanying text. The images and text describe various educational topics.

## Footer

The footer includes copyright information for the year 2021 and links to terms and policies.

## CSS

The CSS file contains styles that define the appearance of the web page, including layout, typography, and colors.

This practice project allowed me to apply responsive design principles and practice structuring HTML and styling with CSS.
